# Checkpoint Command

Create or verify a checkpoint in your workflow.

## Usage

`/checkpoint [create|verify|list] [name]`

## Create Checkpoint

When creating a checkpoint:

1. Run `/verify quick` to ensure current state is clean
2. Create a git stash or commit with checkpoint name
3. Log checkpoint to `.claude/checkpoints.log`:

```bash
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M) | $CHECKPOINT_NAME | $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" >> .claude/checkpoints.log
```

4. Report checkpoint created

## Verify Checkpoint

When verifying against a checkpoint:

1. Read checkpoint from log
2. Compare current state to checkpoint:
   - Files added since checkpoint
   - Files modified since checkpoint (`git diff --stat <sha>`)
   - `/verify` result now vs then

3. Report:
```
CHECKPOINT COMPARISON: $NAME

Files changed: X
